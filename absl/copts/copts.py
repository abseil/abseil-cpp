"""Abseil compiler options.

This is the source of truth for Abseil compiler options.  To modify Abseil
compilation options:

  (1) Edit the appropriate list in this file based on the platform the flag is
      needed on.
  (2) Run `<path_to_absl>/copts/generate_copts.py`.

The generated copts are consumed by configure_copts.bzl and
AbseilConfigureCopts.cmake.
